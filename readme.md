TODO: Actually make a proper readme

Important info: 
Because we're using completely different IDEs, we both use different file types to compile and upload to the Arduino
I can only compile from the src folder, with a .cpp file type. Any code you write has to be a .ino type to open in the 
Arduino IDE - but both these file types are C++ anyways, so we can just rename the extensions if we need to edit a particular file

Please just make sure whatever you push to main keeps ONLY one file (main.cpp) in the src folder, so I don't have compilation errors
Any extra code files you make don't need to go in any folder
